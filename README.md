# Assignment 1: Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) in NumPy and PyTorch

This assignment contains 2 coding parts. Part 1 is to implement a multilayer perceptron (MLP) in NumPy, and part 2 in PyTorch.

# Assignment 2: Transfer Learning for CNNs, Visual Prompting (and GNNs)

The assignment is organized in two parts. The first part covers transfer learning for CNNs, where I fine-tune an existing network to adapt it to a new dataset. In the second part, I prompt CLIP to perform image classification, both in the zero-shot setting and by learning a visual prompt.

# Assignment 3: Deep Generative Models and 3D Computer Vision

This assignment contains 2 coding parts. Part 1 is implementing a variational autoencoder (VAE), and part 2 an adversarial autoencoder (AAE).
